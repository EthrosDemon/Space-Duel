<sect>Introduction
<p>
KSpaceduel is an space arcade game for two players. Each player controls a ship
that flies around the sun and tries to shoot at the other ship.

<sect>Rules of the Game

<sect1>Ship Movement 
<p>
Each player controls one ship. 

The ships can rotate, accelerate, shoot and lay mines.

<sect1>Energy 
<p>
Each ship has an amount of energy (refer to the game options for values). 

Ships need energy for rotation, acceleration, shooting and laying mines. A ship
gets energy from its solar panels. The amount of energy a ship gets depends on
the distance from and direction to the sun. A ship gets more energy near the sun
and less energy near the border. It gets the full amount of energy if the sun
shines directly on the panels and less or even no energy if the sun shines at an
angle to the panel or to the side of the panel.

If a ship has no energy it can't navigate or shoot. 

<sect1>Hit points

Collisions with own or other bullets or mines decrease the hit points of a ship.
If two ships collide, the weaker ship is destroyed and the hit points of the
stronger ship are decreased by the hit points of the weaker ship plus an amount
(Crash Damage). A ship is destroyed when it flies into the sun.

<sect1>Bullets and Mines 
<p>
Bullets fly around the sun like a ship. 

Mines have an amount of energy to stay at the same position. When the energy is
spent, the mine falls into the sun. Mines near the sun need more energy than
those which are further away. 

Mines can be destroyed with bullets. 

By default a ship can have 5 bullets and 3 mines on the screen. 

<sect>Options

<sect1>Keys 
<p>
Keys can be configured with the &quot;Options/Keys...&quot; menu item.

<sect1>Configurations

  <item><bf/Velocity X/ and <bf/Velocity Y:/ velocity at the begin of a new
  round Ship: 
  </itemize>
<item><bf/Ship/
  <itemize>
  <item><bf/Acceleration:/ Acceleration of the ships 
  <item><bf/Energy need:/ The energy needed to accelerate a ship.
